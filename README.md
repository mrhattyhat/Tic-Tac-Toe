# tic-tac-toe
A silly little tic-tac-toe game with some surprises.

An as-yet only partially finished, fully runnable Python and Django based Tic-Tac-Toe game that has some...let's call
them "unusual" behaviors, depending on which game option is chosen.  No matter which game option is chosen, however, 
they all have one thing in common: they are all unbeatable (for very different reasons).
